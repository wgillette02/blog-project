# Blog Webpage

This is a project that I began in January 2021 after taking online classes on Coursera from the University of Michigan about web design. Essentially, this allowed me to learn skills such as user authentication, email verification, and password protection. I also gained more experience with SQLite databases, using embedded javascript, and handling login sessions.
